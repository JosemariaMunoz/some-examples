**Import Users to Liferay from a Java Main using JsonWS**
This is an application that will import user to Liefray portal from a Java Main method, using JsonWs.

It only has one Java class with a 'main' method that you should run in your own IDE (for example). This 'main' method in AddUsers.java will get the file setted in 'csvFile' variable and use it to add user via jsonws API (that belongs to the portal too, https://portal.liferay.dev/docs/7-2/frameworks/-/knowledge_base/f/jax-ws) 

There is an upload example file in  add-users-csv/users-to-import.csv.
